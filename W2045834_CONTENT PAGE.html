            <h2>Goal 15</h2>
            <p>Goal 15 aims to preserve life on land by safeguarding ecosystems, managing forests sustainably, preventing deforestation, and reversing degradation of land in order to prevent biodiversity loss. The Earth's ecosystems are essential for human life, accounting for more than half of global GDP and possessing cultural, spiritual, and economic significance. However, climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss are serious challenges. Between 2015 and 2019, around 100 million hectares of land were degraded annually, affecting 1.3 billion people. Urgent action is required to solve these issues and ensure sustainable growth.</p>

            <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
            <p>Forests, which cover roughly 31% of the Earth's surface, support more than 80% of land species. Despite its importance, biodiversity is quickly decreasing.</p>
            <p>Around one fifth of the world's land surface is degraded, which is roughly the size of India and the Russian Federation combined. Degradation of land not only causes species extinction but also accelerates climate change. However, biodiversity and the ecological services it provides can form the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction efforts, thereby increasing the resilience of humans.</p>

        <section id="WhatDoesLossofForestMean">
            <h2>What does loss of forest mean?</h2>
            <p>The decreasing number of trees leads to the loss of farming income, increased carbon emissions, decreased biodiversity, and degradation of land. Despite ongoing forest loss, data from 2020 show that the share of forests in protected areas and long-term management plans has increased or stayed stable worldwide and in most regions.</p>
            <p>The actions of humans has a permanent impact on the environment, causing species extinction, disturbing natural balance, and reducing ecosystem resilience. A recent United Nations biodiversity study emphasizes a grim scenario, with around 1 million animal and plant species risking extinction, many within decades, constituting an unprecedented threat in human history.</p>

            <h3>How does it affect others?</h3>
            <p>An increasing need for animal protein, increased and unsustainable farming techniques, increased wildlife exploitation, and the climate crisis are all leading to the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19, which are transmitted from wildlife to humans.</p>
            <p>Neglected infectious diseases kill around two million people each year, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. These epidemics also cause severe disease, mortality, and productivity decreases among animal populations in poor nations, perpetuating extreme poverty for hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers.</p>
