        <h1>Sustainable Development</h1>
        <p>
            Our Being Westminster strategy outlines our commitment to being
            progressive, compassionate and responsible to help students and
            colleagues from different backgrounds fulfil their potential and
            contribute to a more sustainable, equitable and healthier
            society.
        </p>
        <p>
            We adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
            (SDGs)
            framework to support this core mission and to record, measure
            and
            improve our contribution to a range of social, environmental and
            economic outcomes.
        </p>
        <h2>Life on Land</h2>
        <p>
            Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial 
            ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, 
            and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            Terrestrial ecosystems are vital for sustaining human life,
            contributing to over half of global GDP and encompassing diverse
            cultural, spiritual, and economic values.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the world faces a triple crisis of climate change,
            pollution and biodiversity loss. Escalating trends of forest
            loss, land degradation and the extinction of species pose a
            severe threat to both the planet and people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite some progress in sustainable forest management,
            protected areas, and the uptake of national biodiversity values
            and natural capital accounting, most improvements have been
            modest. The recently adopted Kunming-Montreal Global
            Biodiversity Framework outlines four outcome-oriented goals 
            to be achieved by 2050 and 23 targets to be achieved by 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
            A fundamental shift in humanityâ€™s relationship with nature is
            essential, along with accelerated action to address the root
            causes of these interconnected crises and better recognition of
            the tremendous value of nature.
