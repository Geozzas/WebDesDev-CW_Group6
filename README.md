Welcome to the Github repository for our Web Design & Development group coursework.

Please read this before adding a file to the repository: 
- Click on "add file".
- You can choose to create a new file and copy & paste your code there OR you can choose to upload the file directly to this repository.
- After confirming the details of the file and the name of the file, click on "Commit changes".
- ! Choose the option "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and name the branch your student number (E.g. student2), & then submit.
- You can now access your code from your "student" branch and open a pull request to update your code to main/vice versa.
- Best to only make changes to your *own* codes in your student branch and open a pull request from your branch to the main branch when you think your code is ok.
- If you are unsure, please ask! Thank you
